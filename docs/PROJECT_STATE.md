## Checkpoint: Pre-Volume 4 Audit (post–Volume 3)

**Repo:** 21 commits, working tree clean, restored-and-reverified from `DataXAi_Volume_03_Repo.zip` this session (sandbox does not persist across sessions — rebuild venv with `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt` after unzipping).

### Implemented (real models, migrations, passing tests)
| App | Models | What's tested |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts` | `User` (custom, `role` field) | token obtain/refresh, `/me/` |
| `core` | `TimeStampedModel` (abstract), `AuditLogEntry` | RBAC matrix (3 roles), exception handler, health check |
| `etl` | `PipelineRun` | model defaults, `SET_NULL` on user delete — **no pipeline logic yet** |
| `healing` | `QuarantineRecord` | `resolve()`, double-resolution guard |
| `warehouse` | `Customer`, `Product`, `OrderLine` | constraints (price ≥0, qty can be negative, unique customer id) |

DRF: JWT auth (SimpleJWT), RBAC permission classes (`core.permissions`), consistent error envelope (`core.exceptions.custom_exception_handler`), shared pagination class. Docker Compose: 6 services (`db`,`cache`,`web`,`worker`,`beat`,`nginx`), YAML-valid.

### Placeholder (app registered, empty `models.py`, no logic)
`clv`, `dashboard`, `detection`, `forecasting`, `nlp`, `validation`.

### Verification status
| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `manage.py check` / `makemigrations --check` / `pytest` | ✅ 29/29 passing, re-run this session |
| `ruff` / `black` / `isort` | ✅ clean |
| `docker compose config` (YAML) | ✅ valid |
| `docker compose build` / `up` / in-container health check | ❌ **NOT VERIFIED** — no Docker daemon in this sandbox (same limitation noted since Volume 2). Needs running on a machine with Docker. |
| `requirements/ml.txt` (pandas, SQLAlchemy, GE, prophet, xgboost, btyd) | ❌ **NOT VERIFIED** — declared, never installed. First real test is Volume 4. |
| Real UCI Online Retail II data flowing through the pipeline | ❌ **NOT VERIFIED** — sandbox network allowlist blocks `archive.ics.uci.edu`; needs the file uploaded or fetched outside this sandbox. |

### Known open design decision (blocking Volume 4's source layer)
Proposal Table 4/M1 pairs SQLAlchemy with "CSV + PostgreSQL" sources. Two readings: SQLAlchemy hits the *same* app DB Django's ORM already owns (redundant), or it hits a *separate* upstream/source DB (matches Figure 1, which draws "PostgreSQL Source" as an External Source outside the pipeline core, and is the only reading where adding SQLAlchemy is justified at all). **Recommendation: separate source DB**, via a new `SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` setting — proceeding on this basis unless corrected.

### Technical debt / deferred
- `forecasting`/`clv` schemas intentionally undesigned until Volumes 8–9 (real field shapes depend on model output).
- No Postgres integration tests yet (all DB tests run against SQLite via `config.settings.test`) — Volume 4 needs at least one test against real Postgres for the source-DB read path.

### Next volume prerequisites (Volume 4 — ETL Engine)
1. Resolve the source-DB decision above (proceeding with recommendation absent objection).
2. Install + smoke-test `pandas`, `SQLAlchemy` for real.
3. A small CSV fixture resembling UCI Online Retail II's columns (generated in-repo, not the full dataset).
